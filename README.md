# Snake Game and Reinforcement Learning

The aim of this project was to solve a **Snake game** using **reinforcement learning**.

The project was divided into two main parts:

- **Building the Game**: This involved generating the grid and establishing the game rules. We created a small graphical interface that allowed manual gameplay.
  
- **Developing the Reinforcement Learning Model**: This part focused on constructing and training the model to achieve the best possible score in the Snake game.
